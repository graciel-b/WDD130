        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        The idea or concept of this site is to present an organized and formal page of a neighborhood committee (in this case Villa Galicia) so that the neighbors have a commonplace and can have access to all the proposals that the committee offers. This will be done so that people can show their art, offer their services, find resources to improve their economic situation, with courses, workshops, etc., and have the possibility of finding a place of support and help. The central idea is to “help each other in an organized way.”
        We try to offer as easy as possible access to all the options that the committee offers so that everyone can find the right place they are looking for on the website.
        These options include recreation, artistic events, courses, workshops, services, a job board, a question-and-answer blog, and a support forum.
        In this case, the website will be inaugurated with an art competition (for people over 18 years of age) and a fair for artisans and micro-entrepreneurs.
        “Art is an activity where a man can recreate part of his reality, his feelings, emotions, ideas, and beauty. With art we create catharsis, we open ourselves. Art is therapeutic, and liberating. Art helps us strengthen self-esteem, and self-confidence, and connect with others. It gives us peace, reduces stress, enhances our memory, and improves our concentration.”
        
      </p>
      <p><b>Art Competition</b>
        The contest will be aimed at those neighbors who dedicate themselves to artistic painting and modeling on an amateur basis and give them the opportunity to compete for cash, credits, and the possibility of competing at the national level. This will be an incentive for those who, due to low economic or social resources (many contests are paid or directed to important people) do not have or have access to progress in their art
      </p>
      <p><b>Crafts Fair and Buffet</b>
        For neighbors who have other gifts and talents and want to show them or have the possibility of selling them, there will be an artisan fair where they will be given a space to exhibit their entrepreneurship or art. The authorized items will be those that are 70% handmade with any type of materials and that maintain an appropriate code of decency. No food will be allowed, except cookies, puddings, cakes, and preserves (for more information, contact the contact methods suggested on the website).
        The committee will provide a buffet with food and drinks for sale throughout the weekend. The proceeds will be donated to charities and community kitchens in the neighborhood.

        "Painting is a means of communication, which transmits ideas and reproduces thoughts through them, it is a form of visual expression where different colors and shapes provoke feelings and emotions in us that lead us to interpret in a different way what they want us to do.” communicate” (Painting as a means of communication, by Mirada Infinita)
        The base and painting materials will be to the participant's taste, while the work is 100% by hand. Materials may be provided if requested. The measurements will be a maximum of 30 x 30 cm

      <h3>[Page 3]Molded or Sculpture Category</h3>
      <p>
        "The modeling technique favors the development of fine motor skills; it is also considered that it should be applied from an early age in order to contribute to strengthening the development of visual-manual coordination that will enhance the reading-writing process." (Muñoz Torres, Carmen Rocío)
        For this item, any molding material can be used, as long as the work is 100% handmade and from scratch. If the material must be baked, an oven will be provided for this purpose (more detailed information will be provided if necessary). The pieces may not exceed 2 kilograms and the measurements will be up to 20 x 20 cm
