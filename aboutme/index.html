        <ul>
        <li>I tell you that I am from Buenos Aires, Argentina. I am 53 years old, I have been divorced for 9 years and I have two beautiful children. My daughter, 23, lives in the United States and my youngest son, 20, lives here with me.</li>
        <li>At the moment I work as a pedicure at home.</li>
        <li>I have been a member of the Church for 5 and a half years and I feel that it is my place in the faith. I am a Family Search service missionary and Temple ordinance worker. This is how I feel useful and grateful to the Lord.</li>
        <li>I really like doing crafts, especially knitting and mosaicism. I also like science fiction and forensic movies. I love music, especially pop from previous decades and classical, Celtic music, to meditate.</li>
        <li>Until last semester I was doing the Administrative Assistant certificate but I wasn't happy, so I looked for a change and here I am, starting from scratch. I hope that with the help of the Lord, the teacher and all of you I can move forward and live up to the demands. Despite my age, I hope to achieve success and be able to work as a programmer and also be able to help with this.</li>
